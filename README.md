# Finite Grids

Finite Grids is a project surrounding completeness, the completeness of every possible iteration of an 8x8 black and white grid. The ordered grid you see is always unique, and has 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 possible states, a finite set, but impossible for a human to comprehend. As the calculations below show, the ordered grid will take 1.9 billion years to complete, longer than this website probably, and the randomized grid would take an estimated 86 billion years.
